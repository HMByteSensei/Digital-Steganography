# Steganography Application Overview

## Introduction:

- Steganography is the art and science of concealing information within other non-secret data to ensure its secrecy and security. Unlike encryption, which focuses on scrambling the contents of a message to make it unreadable without the appropriate decryption key, steganography aims to hide the very existence of the message itself.


- In the digital world, steganography involves embedding secret messages, images, or files within seemingly innocuous carrier files, such as images, audio files, video files, or even text documents. 


- This repository contains algorithms and techniques for steganography, providing methods for embedding data covertly into multimedia files and extracting hidden information without arousing suspicion. By exploring these methods, users can gain insights into the principles of steganography and its applications in digital communication and security.
